The haplotypes are available from the 1000GP website or the IMPUTE2 website.

#### 21 Mar 2013
Our paper describing the genetic variation of short insertions and deletions using sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project has been published by [Genome Research](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2013/03/11/gr.148718.112)

#### 29 Dec 2012
Our paper describing the SHAPEIT (v2) method has been published in [Nature Methods](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n1/full/nmeth.2307.html)

In this paper we develop a method for carrying out admixture deconvolution with more than two source ancestral populations. The method can handle both phased or unphased data from the source and/or sample populations. The method was used to analyze data from Phase 1 of the 1000 Genomes Project which was recently published in Nature. The MULTIMIX software implementing this approach will appear here soon.
