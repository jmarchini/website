It takes BGEN files as input and avoids repeated decompression and conversion of these files when analyzing multiple continuous phenotypes. It was written for the analysis of the UK Biobank dataset (which is stored in the BGEN v1.2 file format ). This dataset consists of genetic data on ~500,000 individuals, ~93 Million autosomal variants and thousands of phenotypes. It works with indexed BGEN files yielding fast access for any (group of) SNPs. This feature facilitates very fast PHEWAS. BGENIE uses the Eigen matrix library and OpenMP to carry out as many of the linear algebra operations in parallel as possible. For example, estimation of effect sizes of large numbers of SNPs can be carried out in parallel using matrix operations, and indexing of missing data values is used to allow for fast estimation of standard errors. It has built in functionality to apply PCA or ICA (using the fastICA algorithm) to multiple phenotypes and use the resulting transformed phenotypes for testing via GWAS. Basic Usage: BGENIE performs a linear association test between SNP/phenotype pairs in the provided data. A basic command to run GWAS on all the phenotypes is: bgenie --bgen example.bgen --pheno example.pheno --out example.out If you wish to specify a range of SNPs specified by position (useful if you wish to split the genome up into multiple jobs) you can use the \u2013range option, for example: bgenie --bgen example.bgen --pheno example.pheno --out example.out --range 22 20000000 21000000 If you wish to analyse just a single SNP you can select it using the \u2013rsid option, for example: bgenie --bgen example.bgen --pheno example.pheno --out example.out --rsid rs573069994 Full options list Input options --bgen <file.bgen> (Required) The BGEN file containing the genetic data for the subjects in the analysis must be specified by the file . It helps to have the BGEN file indexed (i.e produce a BGI file), which allows efficient PHEWAS and ranged based operations. See tools QCTOOL and BGENIX for more information about these sorts of files. --pheno <file.pheno> (Required) The phenotypes for the subjects in the study must be specified by the file . This must be a space separated file, wherein the first line is a header line specifying the names of each phenotype as a space separated list, and the remaining lines specifying the values of the phenotypes for each subject. The subjects must be presented in the same order that they are found in the BGEN file. If a SAMPLE file has been provided to accompany the BGEN files, then this order can be found by examining the SAMPLE file. Alternatively, if the subject IDs are present in the BGEN file, then they can be found using the qctool software, with the command qctool -g example.bgen -os example.sample (in some datasets, such as UK BIOBANK, the subject IDs are stripped from the BGEN files, in which case an accompanying SAMPLE file must be relied upon). Missing values must be encoded by the code -999, or the code specified by the argument to the --miss parameter. An example phenotype file is provided in the following listing: Height(in) Weight(lbs) 58 115 59 117 60 120 61 123 62 -999 In this example phenotype file, the height and weight are given for 5 subjects, and the 5-th subject has a missing weight measurement. --covar <file.cov> Specifies that covariates to be removed from the analysis are read from the file file.cov. The format of this file is the same as that for the phenotype file: it is space separated and the first line is a header specifying the names of the covariates. The remaining lines specify the values of the covariates for the subjects (the subjects must be ordered in the same order as they are given in the phenotype file). As for the phenotype file, the code -999 must be used to specify missing covariates (this code can be modified by using the --miss parameter). Covariates are removed by replacing each phenotype by the residuals found after a multilinear regression between the phenotype and all of the covariates (with the intercept fit). Each subject with at least one missing covariate will be dropped from the analysis. --miss <int> This option can be used to change the code for missing values in the phenotype file file.pheno and covariate file file.cov to the integer value of int. The default value of is -999. Output file options --out <file.out> (Required argument.) This parameter specifies the output file. The results of the analysis will be saved in the file file.out.gz, with gzip compression. This is a compressed space separated file. The first line of the output file is a header giving the column names for each column in the file. The first 7 columns provide information about the SNP. These columns are as follows: The chromosome on which the SNP resides. The name of the SNP (rsid). The position of the SNP. The character code for the first allele (a string). The character code for the second allele (a string). The allele frequency of the second allele (if the second allele is the minor allele, this is the MAF). The information score of the SNP (the quality of imputation). For the remaining columns, the results of the linear association test are provided in groups of three columns per phenotype. In these remaining columns, the beta coefficient, standard error and t-statistic for the linear association are provided. In the regression model we code the first and second alleles as 0 and 1 respectively, so the beta coefficient refers to the effect of having an extra copy of the second allele. An example of the first 10 columns of an uncompressed ouput file are provided in the following listing: chr rsid pos a_0 a_1 af info pheno1_beta pheno1_se pheno1_t ... 22 22:16050075:A:G 16050075 A G 0.0001 1 0.00067749 0.01008 0.067215 ... 22 22:16050115:G:A 16050115 G A 0.00545 1 -0.00022679 0.010577 -0.021441 ... 22 22:16050213:C:T 16050213 C T 0.00635 1 -0.0053945 0.010732 -0.50266 ... 22 22:16050319:C:T 16050319 C T 0.00115 1 -0.0072811 0.010548 -0.69025 ... 22 22:16050527:C:A 16050527 C A 0.00045 1 -0.010907 0.011428 -0.95444 ... 22 22:16050568:C:A 16050568 C A 0.00025 1 -0.0024885 0.011269 -0.22083 ... 22 22:16050607:G:A 16050607 G A 0.0006 1 0.013246 0.010527 1.2583 ... 22 22:16050627:G:T 16050627 G T 0.0004 1 -0.00043928 0.01008 -0.04358 ... ...

This listing shows the results of the association test for the first and second phenotype. Note that subject IDs and family IDs must not be included in this file. Instead, they are inferred from the BGEN file. --pvals By default, the p-values for the association tests are not provided in the output file, as they can be inferred by the beta coefficient and the t-statistic. If this output is desired, the --pvals parameter may be provided, in which case the output file will include four consecutive columns for each phenotype. The first three are as described above (beta coefficient, standard error and t-statistic), and the fourth is the -log10 p-value of the association. If this parameter is provided, then in the example listings shown for the \u2013out parameter above, columns 8 to 11 of the output file will be as follows: ... pheno1_beta pheno1_se pheno1_t pheno1_p ... ... 0.00067749 0.01008 0.067215 0.02392 ... ... -0.00022679 0.010577 -0.021441 0.0074933 ... ... -0.0053945 0.010732 -0.50266 0.21097 ... ... -0.0072811 0.010548 -0.69025 0.30975 ... ... -0.010907 0.011428 -0.95444 0.46866 ... ... -0.0024885 0.011269 -0.22083 0.083424 ... ... 0.013246 0.010527 1.2583 0.68125 ... ... -0.00043928 0.01008 -0.04358 0.015365 ... ... The remaining columns are provided in groups of four for each phenotype. --dosage <file> If this flag is provided, the dosage for each SNP/sample pair is written to the provided file. --dump_phenotypes This option specifies that phenotypes are written to a file. The file name will have the same name as that specified by \u2013out with the suffix .phenos This is useful for understanding the results of ICA and PCA flags, and also missingness filters. Filtering options --exc_missing_inds If this parameter is provided, then all subjects with at least one missing phenotype value will be removed from the analysis. --include_pheno <pheno.cov> If this parameter is provided, then only phenotypes listed in the file pheno.cov will be analysed. This file must contain one phenotype name per line, and the phenotype names must match the names of the phenotypes provided in the header line of the phenotype file. --range <start_pos> <end_pos> This option restricts analysis to SNPs falling in the range to (measured in basepairs) on the chromosome . The index BGI file for the argument to .The BGEN index file file.bgi must exist for this option to work. Also, the chromosome name must match exactly the chromosome name given in the BGEN file (i.e. if the BGEN file names chromosome 1 as 01, then must be 01to specify chromosome 1.) --rsid <rsid> If this parameter is provided, then a PHEWAS is performed on the SNP named . The format of the output file is the same as that specified for the parameter --out, except it will only have two lines: the first line will be headers and the second line will be the corresponding values for the PHEWAS against the specified SNP. --include_rsids <file> This option allows you to specify a list of RS IDs and then analysis if only run at this markers. The file should contain one RS ID per line. Runtime options --thread <n> This option controls the number of threads used by BGENIE will be given to . By default, the number of threads is found by examining the OpenMP environment defaults. --chunk <n> BGENIE processes the genetic data in chunks. To specify the size of the chunk (in SNPs), this parameter may be provided, and the size of the chunk will be set to . The value of should be large enough to avoid thread overhead, but small enough to allow RAM usage to not be exceeded. The default value of 256 works for most conditions. Phenotype and genotype transformations --scale_phenotypes By default, beta and se for each marker tested are computed without normalizing phenotypes or genotypes. Phenotypes can be scaled by including this flag. This does not affect p-values or t-statistics. --scale_genotypes By default, beta and se for each marker tested are computed without normalizing phenotypes or genotypes. Genotypes can be scaled by including this flag. This does not affect p-values or t-statistics. --pca_only <var> If this option is provided, then the phenotypes will be replaced by the score matrix found by conducting a PCA on the entire set of phenotypes. The score matrix will be restricted to the top principal components that explain the proportion of the variance (i.e. must be a real number in the interval (0, 1], and the score matrix used in the analysis will explain 100* % of the variance in the phenotypes). --pca_plus <var> This parameter is similar to --pca_only, except in addition to the score matrix, analysis will also be performed on all of the untransformed phenotypes. The score matrix will be horizontally concatenated by the phenotype file, and the linear test will be performed between each column of the resulting matrix and all of the SNPs. The identity of the columns in the resulting output file will be clear by the header line. --pca_scale_phenotypes By default, the PCA operations described above do not rescale the phenotypes before they are applied. This makes sense if all of the phenotypes in the phenotype file have identical units. If rescaling is required before application of PCA, then this option should be used. --ica_only <k> If this parameter is provided, then the phenotypes will be replaced by an ICA transformation in which the projections of the phenotypes onto the top independent components are considered for analysis. This is done using the fastICA algorithm. must be a positive integer, less than or equal to the number of phenotypes presented. --ica_plus <k> This parameter is similar to --ica_only, but like --pca_plus it horizontally concatenates the untransformed phenotypes with the ICA transformation specified above.

The score matrix will be restricted to the top principal components that explain the proportion of the variance (i.e. must be a real number in the interval (0, 1], and the score matrix used in the analysis will explain 100* % of the variance in the phenotypes). --pca_plus <var> This parameter is similar to --pca_only, except in addition to the score matrix, analysis will also be performed on all of the untransformed phenotypes. The score matrix will be horizontally concatenated by the phenotype file, and the linear test will be performed between each column of the resulting matrix and all of the SNPs. The identity of the columns in the resulting output file will be clear by the header line. --pca_scale_phenotypes By default, the PCA operations described above do not rescale the phenotypes before they are applied. This makes sense if all of the phenotypes in the phenotype file have identical units. If rescaling is required before application of PCA, then this option should be used. --ica_only <k> If this parameter is provided, then the phenotypes will be replaced by an ICA transformation in which the projections of the phenotypes onto the top independent components are considered for analysis. This is done using the fastICA algorithm. must be a positive integer, less than or equal to the number of phenotypes presented. --ica_plus <k> This parameter is similar to --ica_only, but like --pca_plus it horizontally concatenates the untransformed phenotypes with the ICA transformation specified above.","title":"Phenotype and genotype transformations"},{"location":"bgenie/#miscellaneous","text":"--version Print information about the version of BGENIE used.","title":"Miscellaneous"},{"location":"licence/","text":"LICENCE LICENCE TERMS FOR ACCESS TO SOFTWARE FOR ACADEMIC USE These licence terms apply to all licences granted by THE CHANCELLOR, MASTERS AND SCHOLARS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD whose administrative offices are at University Offices, Wellington Square, Oxford OX1 2JD, United Kingdom (the \u201cUniversity\u201d) for use of or access to the Genetic Software Suite (\u201cthe Software\u201d) through this website https://jmarchini.org/ (the \u201cWebsite\u201d).

AJHG 93 (4) 687-696. 18 Sep 2013 We have just released a new version of the Phase 1 haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project. Using a set of validation genotypes at SNP and biallelic indels we have been able to show that these haplotypes have lower genotype discordance and improved imputation performance into downstream GWAS samples, especially at low frequency. The haplotypes are available from the 1000GP website or the IMPUTE2 website. 21 Mar 2013 Our paper describing the genetic variation of short insertions and deletions using sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project has been published by Genome Research 29 Dec 2012 Our paper describing the SHAPEIT (v2) method has been published in Nature Methods This paper presents a significantly new algorithm for haplotype estimation that combines together the best ideas from IMPUTE2 and SHAPEIT1. The new method clearly outperforms other existing methods in terms of phasing performance and is very competitive computationally. 6 Dec 2012 We have just released a new version of MULTIMIX (v1.1.0). This new version allows for missing data. 4 Dec 2012 We have just released a new versions of SHAPEIT (v2). The paper on this new version has now been accepted in Nature Methods and will appear soon. 10 Nov 2012 Olivier Delaneau has won a Charles Epstein Post-Doctoral Award (worth $2,000) at the ASHG conference in San Francisco for his work on SHAPEIT2. Well done Olivier! Androniki Menelaou made the final of the Pre-Doctoral competition (worth $1,000) but did not win a prize. 7 Nov 2012 Claire Churchhouse\u2019s paper has been published in Genetic Epidemiology In this paper we develop a method for carrying out admixture deconvolution with more than two source ancestral populations. The method can handle both phased or unphased data from the source and/or sample populations. The method was used to analyze data from Phase 1 of the 1000 Genomes Project which was recently published in Nature. The MULTIMIX software implementing this approach will appear here soon. 1 November 2012 Jonathan Marchini has been awarded a Philip Leverhulme Prize 1 November 2012 The latest 1000 Genomes Project paper has been published in Nature today. This is a big international collaboration that has sort to sequence a large number of individuals from around the world with the aim of mapping the majority of the genetic variation with frequency above 1%. Members of our group that contributed to the analysis were Olivier Delaneau, Claire Churchhouse, Jason Liu and myself. The project has been reported in the mainstream press. 1 November 2012 The company Affymetrix has launched a new genotyping chip that was designed using our software IMPUTE2. They have issued a press release giving the details 23 October 2012 Androniki Menelaou\u2019s paper has been published in Bioinformatics In this paper we show that combining low-coverage sequence data with microarray genotyping on the same subjects can lead to high quality haplotype reference sets that produce a notable boost in downstream imputation accuracy. The MVNcall software implementing this approach will appear here soon. 2 October 2012 Jared O\u2019Connell won the poster prize at the recent Genomics of Common Diseases conference in Potomac, MD, USA. 27 August 2012 We have done very well this year with accepted talks at the American Society of Human Genetics meeting.

This page details some of that work. Genomics England and the 100,000 Genomes Project Genomics England (GEL) aims to enable faster, deeper genomic research, bringing genomic healthcare to all who need it. The GEL flagship project has sequenced 100,000 whole genomes from NHS patients with rare diseases, and their families, as well as patients with common cancers. We were awarded a Wellcome Trust Collaborative Award to produce a set of derived data sets and analysis tools from the GEL genome sequences that will have high value for human genetics studies, including disease genetics studies both on the GEL subjects themselves and third party studies. This was joint work with Simon Myers and Garrett Hellenthal. Specific aims include Phase the genome sequences to generate the world\u2019s largest haplotype reference panel, empowering very low frequency imputation for genome wide association studies. Impute the UK Biobank dataset using the GEL reference panel, and provide the imputed data back to UK Biobank for use by approved researchers. Use the phased genomes to characterize the fine genetic structure of the English population at an unprecedented level, providing knowledge for population structure matching and adjustment for disease studies. UK Biobank The UK Biobank is one of the largest bio-medical and research databases in the world, consisting of extensive data collected on 500,00 UK individuals. Our group played a central role in the production and analysis of the genome-wide genotyping array and imputed dataset. This work was published in Nature Bycroft et al. (2017) Genome-wide genetic data on ~500,000 UK Biobank participants. Nature 562:203\u2013209l In addition we worked to analyze the brain MRI phenotypes produced by the project and this was also published in Nature Elliott et al. (2018) Genome-wide association studies of brain structure and function in the UK Biobank. Nature 562:210\u2013216 Haplotype Reference Consortium The aim of the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) was to create a large reference panel of human haplotypes by combining together sequencing data from multiple cohorts. From 2015 this resource has been used to impute many GWAS samples around the world. This has been greatly facilitated by imputation servers developed in Michigan, USA and Cambridge, UK . I co-led this project with Richard Durbin and Goncalo Abecasis. The Haplotype Reference Consortium. A reference panel of 64,976 haplotypes for genotype imputation. Nature Genetics 10.1038/ng.3643 CONVERGE The China, Oxford and Virginia Commonwealth University Experimental Research on Genetic Epidemiology (CONVERGE) project on Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) sequenced 11,670 female Han Chinese at low-coverage (1.7X), providing the first large-scale whole genome sequencing resource representative of the largest ethnic group in the world. Samples are collected from 58 hospitals from 23 provinces around China. Our group contributed to the project by working on genotype imputation from the low-coverage sequencing data and this resulted in a paper in Nature . 1000 Genomes Project The 1000 Genomes Project was an international consortium that sought to characterize human genetic variation above 1% frequency using whole-genome sequencing. Our group played a central role in many aspects of the analysis. The contribution was the development of fast and accurate methods for genotype estimation and phasing from the genotype likelihoods produced from the whole-genome sequencing. In addition, we developed high specialised methods that allowed us to infer genotypes and phase CNVs and other classes of structural variation.

The dataset consisted of 4,000 cases of seven common diseases and 3,000 shared controls. A follow-on project analyzed common CNVs in the same set of samples.

The GEL flagship project has sequenced 100,000 whole genomes from NHS patients with rare diseases, and their families, as well as patients with common cancers. We were awarded a Wellcome Trust Collaborative Award to produce a set of derived data sets and analysis tools from the GEL genome sequences that will have high value for human genetics studies, including disease genetics studies both on the GEL subjects themselves and third party studies. This was joint work with Simon Myers and Garrett Hellenthal. Specific aims include Phase the genome sequences to generate the world\u2019s largest haplotype reference panel, empowering very low frequency imputation for genome wide association studies. Impute the UK Biobank dataset using the GEL reference panel, and provide the imputed data back to UK Biobank for use by approved researchers.

[R package] GxE Interactions LEMMA LEMMA (Linear Environment Mixed Model Analysis) is a whole genome wide regression method for flexible modeling of gene-environment interactions in large datasets such as the UK Biobank. The method estimates a linear combination of environmental variables, called an environmental score (ES), that interacts with genetic markers throughout the genome, and provides a readily interpretable way to examine the combined effect of many environmental variables. The ES can be used both to estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance attributable to GxE effects, and also to test for GxE effects at genetic variants across the genome.

This method continues to refine the observation made in the IMPUTE2 method, that accuracy is optimized via use of a custom subset of haplotypes when imputing each individual. It achieves fast, accurate, and memory-efficient imputation by selecting haplotypes using the Positional Burrows Wheeler Transform (PBWT). By using the PBWT data structure at genotyped markers, IMPUTE 5 identifies locally best matching haplotypes and long identical by state segments. The method then uses the selected haplotypes as conditioning states within the IMPUTE model. IMPUTE5 is up to 30x faster than MINIMAC4 and up to 3x faster than BEAGLE5.1 S. Rubinacci, O. Delaneau, J.

Prelims Statistics (Unsupervised Learning) I developed this course to double the amount of Statistics taught to 1st year Maths/Stats students at Oxford (2016-2017) The aim of the course is to introduce students to the theory and practice of unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning can be described as finding structure in datasets, and has applications in many areas such as finance, retail, medical imaging, sports performance analysis, genetics, medicine, studies of the environment and social networks. Unsupervised learning methods are important parts of Computational Statistics, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data. Motivating example Raw dataset : 300 x 8686 matrix of gene expression measurements from Pollen et al (2014) Nature Biotechnology 32, 1053-1058 Viewing the raw data it is very difficult to see any clear structure or similarity between the samples. 3D Projection and clustering : The method of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has been applied to the dataset in order to uncover structure. A clustering method (k-means) has then been applied to group observations in distinct groupings or clusters. Students will learn the theory and practical skills to reproduce this analysis. Lecture slides and course notes Students should take notes in each lecture, but I will use slides as visual aids to illustrate various concepts and results. slides.pdf Here is a link to the course notes course_notes.pdf Exercise sheets There will be 3 exercise sheets for this part of the course. Sheet pdf 1 sheet6.pdf 2 sheet7.pdf 3 sheet8.pdf R/Matlab exercises Each sheet will contain a mix of written questions and Optional questions to be done either using R or Matlab. It is up to each college tutor to decide whether students should attempt these questions, but it is strongly recommended, as these questions will help with understanding of the theory. Modern statistics is pervasive in the era of \u201cBig Data\u201d. The majority of Maths graduates will go on to careers that involve some use of data, so a firm practical grounding in statistical analysis is highly valuable. An aim of this course is to get students started on being able to independently carry out statistical data analysis. As many student will not have worked with R, here is a short tutorial document that will introduce R, show students how to install R and get started with some basics.

The course will be based on the R programming language which is now widely used in all branches of applied statistics. Lectures and practical sessions There will be 6 classes, made up of a lecture followed by a computer practical session (using R): all lectures and all practical sessions are an essential part of the course.
